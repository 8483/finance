# Earnings yields (Important)

Earnings yields = 1 / PE ratio

Example:

S&P500 PE ratio of 28.82 has an earnings yield of 1/28.82 = 0.034 i.e. 3.5%.

A 3-month US treasury bond has a yield of 4.3%.

You have a guaranteed 4.3% vs a potential 3.5%... This means that the stock market is overvalued and you should sell because it will go down.

This is exactly the same as running a huge business with 2% net profits, whereas a bond wound have been DOUBLY profitable. It's more profitable to close it.

You have a guaranteed 4.3% vs a potential 3.5%...
