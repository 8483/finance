According to the forces of supply and demand, no trade can occur until one participant is willing to sell the stock at a price (the ASK price) at which another is willing to buy it (the BID price).

If there are more people who want to buy a stock than people who are willing to sell the stock–there are more buyers than sellers–the stock's price will rise due to increased demand. On the other hand, if more people are selling a given stock than are buying it, its price will decrease.

BUY:
Market order: current price
Limit order: buy when target price is reached
