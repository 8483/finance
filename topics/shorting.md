In order to short, you will need a margin account (not a cash account)

First, you need an broker. You borrow stocks from the broker, let's say 1,000 shares of a company, at $1 dollar each. Note that you're not spending any money here, you're borrowing them. This is important. Now, you go and sell those shares to someone else, and get $1,000. You COULD us this $1,000 to pay back your broker, but why do that? Instead, you wait until the stock price drops, let's say to $0.50 a share. Now, you can buy back 1,000 shares for $500, and return those 1,000 borrowed shares to your broker. You just made $500 by the stock of the company going down, and the broker (usually representing people who go "long") doesn't notice anything: you borrowed 1,000 shares, and returned 1,000 shares, but you made money on it.

Shares in a company are worth, letâ€™s say , $100 and a short seller believes the company is going down. So theyâ€™ll borrow letâ€™s say 10 shares from their broker with an expiry date to return the shares, I believe interest is charged too. So they get their 10 shares worth $1000 (10\*$100) and immediately sell them. Now they wait until the price goes down letâ€™s say to $1. They can then buy 10 for $10 and return the shares to the broker and they made $990 - interest.

The advantage of short-selling is that you don't need to have the money up front to buy the item that you want to make a profit on. You essentially borrow the currency (or shares, if you're shorting stock) from someone else, promising to give it back a short time later -- think of it as a very short term loan.

Naked short: They short a stock saying they will borrow one within 21 days. But then they never borrow one? In effect creating shares out of thin air that they dump on the market?

I finally get it now:
A loans 1 share to B
B short sells it to C
C then loans the share out to D
D also short sells it
Even though only 1 share is involved the short interest is now 2 because D owes C 1 share, and B owes A 1 share. D could buy and close the short with C, now C has a share that B could buy and close with A and the whole thing is unwound. Only problem is D sold the share to WSB... and WE AREN'T SELLING!!! ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ

Short float is the number of shares short sellers have borrowed from the float. A stockâ€™s float is the shares that are available to the public. Youâ€™ve got shares outstanding, which are all the shares that exist for that stock. Some shares are restricted, meaning the average trader canâ€™t access them. That leaves us the floatâ€¦ Twice a month, brokers report the number of shares short sellers are borrowing. The borrowed shares come from the float. The short float percentage is the percentage of the float thatâ€™s borrowed. Itâ€™s also called SHORT INTEREST ex. 15m shares out of 100 mil is 15% SI.

Short float and short interest can tell you a lot about a stock. Why? Itâ€™s a measure of sentiment. You have to pay interest on borrowed shares. So if the short float is high, you know that people are committed to their belief that the price will go lower. You often see high short ratios on beaten-down stocks. On the flip side, sometimes you have a high short float on an uptrending stock. Those tortured shorts are looking to get out. That can cause a rapid increase in price and a short squeeze.

100%+ ownership
I own 1 million shares of a company's stock. The company has only issued 1 million shares. Either I, or my broker (with or without my knowledge) agree to lend out my stock to you. You borrow my stock, and sell it to someone else.
Because of reporting requirements, I have already reported that I own 1 million shares of the stock. I'm not going to file saying I own 0 shares now, because, well I still own it. It's just lent out.
But now the other party who bought follows reporting requirements and files that THEY own 1 million shares of the stock.
So now, on a company with only 1 million shares of stock, there are 2 million shares being reported as owned.

short squeeze (where shorts are forced to sell but other investors have bought up all the available shares to buy so they have to pay an exorbitantly higher price causing the shorts to lose a crap ton of money).

Margin call:

The max loss on a short stock is unlimited, but your position will need to be closed if losses grow too large and your funds are inadequate to continue holding the position. This is called a margin call.

Buying shares on margin basically means borrowing the money to buy the shares. The idea is that you borrow $X today, buy shares with it, wait until the shares appreciate in value, sell them for $Y, then repay the $X you borrowed, such that $X is less than $Y, and you make $Y â€“ $X in profit.
A margin call is what happens when the party that lent you the $X requires you to pay them back, either in whole or (basically always) in part. This can happen if the value of the shares you bought on margin goes down instead of up. You can be required to deposit either cash or shares into your margin account to bring the value of that account up above a minimum limit set by your brokerage.

A margin call is a broker's demand on an investor using margin to deposit additional money or securities so that the margin account is brought up to the minimum maintenance margin. Margin calls occur when your account value depresses to a value calculated by the broker's particular formula. The margin is essentially the difference between what you own and what you owe (your "equity" or "capital" in the position.)
You would receive a margin call from a broker if one or more of the securities you had bought (with borrowed money) decreased in value past a certain point. You would be forced either to deposit more money in the account or to sell off some of your assets.
You would also receive a margin call if you took a short position and the underlying shares increased in value past the minimum margin requirement (because your liabilities would be increasing.)

Ladder attack:
Artificially bringing the price down by selling amongst each other with decimal differences.

You're selling a Toyota corolla for 10k. You have 2 guys come and lowball you. They offer you 8k, you decline. They then make a bunch of ads on Craigslist listing Toyota corollas for 5k so when you look online you think your car is worth less. Then they come back and offer you 5k and you think your getting fair market value. That's what this ladder selling is. It's that simple, don't fall for it. Your GME is worth 10k, just like your second hand corolla
