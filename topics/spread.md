# Spread

`BID` - Highest price a buyer is prepared to pay.

`ASK` - Lowest price a seller will accept.

No trade can occur until one participant is willing to `SELL` stock for an `ASK` price, which another can `BUY` as a `BID` price.

-   `BUY` someone's `ASK` price.
-   `SELL` at your own `BID` price.

If there are more people who want to buy a stock than people who are willing to sell the stock–there are more buyers than sellers–the stock's price will rise due to increased demand. On the other hand, if more people are selling a given stock than are buying it, its price will decrease.

BUY:

-   Market order: current price
-   Limit order: buy when target price is reached

# Explanation

So there's actually 2 prices for any stock, the current `BID` price and current `ASK` price.

The "price" you hear quoted is often the "mid price", a number that's halfway between the two.
The current `BID` price is the highest price that someone, right now, is offering to BUY a certain amount of stock, and the current `ASK` price is the lowest price that someone, right now, is offering to SELL you a certain amount of their stock.

The `BID` price is always lower than the `ASK` price, because if it wasn't one side would have just taken the other's offer instead of making a standing offer of their own.

If someone wants to sell a few stocks quickly, they're not going to sell it for $1, they're going to sell it for the current `BID` price because someone is already lined up and waiting to give them money at that price.

However, if a lot of sell orders go through quickly, it can deplete all the highest waiting `BID` orders, and that WILL drive down the current `BID` price. In fact, more people coming in to sell quickly than buyers line up to submit more `BIDS` is precisely how a stock price goes down.

# Example

To make it more clear, you can imagine for any given stock there are two groups of people standing there with signs.

One group looks like this:

-   I will buy 10 StockX for $12 each.
-   I will buy 5 StockX for $11 each.
-   I will buy 8 StockX for $10 each.

And one group looks like this:

-   I will sell 5 StockX for $15 each.
-   I will sell 12 StockX for $16 each.
-   I will sell 6 StockX for $17 each.

If you see those two groups, the current `BID` price of StockX is $12, and the current `ASK` price is $15. The mid price is $13.50.

If you want to buy a stock, you can either go to the seller group and pay $15 for it, or you can stand in the buyer group and hold up a sign offering $13 for it. The first option will complete immediately but cost more, while the second option gets you a cheaper price but forces you to wait until someone comes up and takes your offer (which may take a while or might even never happen).

Likewise, if you want to sell a stock, you do the same with the opposite group
