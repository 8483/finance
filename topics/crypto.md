coinbase = FIAT to crypto exchange

The bought crypto sits in the exchange, similar to money in a bank.

You can move the crypto to a wallet.

Wallets can be hot (app) or cold (hardware).

Wallets have a public address, which is used for wallet transfers.

Bitcoin uses proof of work i.e. you get transaction verification based on spent electricity.
Ethereum uses proof of stake i.e. you get transaction verification based on risked stake.
