# Moving Average Convergence Divergence - MACD

Momentum indicator showing trends by looking at the difference between two moving averages.

-   Fast moving average (12 days).
-   Slow moving average (26 days).

The MACD indicator is used with a signal line (9 days) too look for crossovers as buy/sell signals.

There's also a histogram that shows the crossovers much more clearly.

Buy when the MACD crosses below the signal line, sell when it crosses above it.
